# Appeal Decision

# Petition No. C22330052

from both Parties, and ultimately concluded that Landlord was liable to Tenant only for part of the time during which the mold and humidity issue existed at the Property. The Hearing Officer’s apparent practice of complimenting and encouraging both Parties throughout the Hearing does not rise to a level of improper bias. His impartiality is evidenced by the careful consideration of all of the evidence from both Parties and reasoned conclusion in the HO Decision.

# V. Conclusion

As detailed above, the RHC denies the Appeal in its entirety and affirms the Decision in its entirety:

1. Petitioner-Tenants satisfied their burden of proof to demonstrate Landlord’s failure to maintain a habitable premises for the period from January 4, 2023 through July 1, 2023 due to the existence of humidity and mold on the Property.
2. During the period from January 4, 2023 through July 1, 2023, Tenants experienced a significant reduction in the value of the Property arising out of limitations on their use of the Property and the physical effects of the humidity/mold condition on their health. As a result, they are entitled to a forty percent (40%) reduction in the value of the Property for the period in question.
3. Rent during the period was $2,398 per month, or $97.93 per day. Forty percent (40%) of $97.93 is $39.17 per day. There are 180 days between January 3, 2023 and July 1, 2023. Therefore, Tenants are entitled to a total Rent refund of $7,050.60 to be provided to Tenants as a rent credit at such time that this Appeal Decision becomes final. If Tenants vacate the Property, the portion of the award that has not been credited by the Landlord shall be paid to the Tenants within thirty (30) days of the date Tenants vacate the Premises.
