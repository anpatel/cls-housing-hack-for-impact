# Appeal Decision

# Petition C22230037

Respondent argues that Hearing Officer incorrectly found that Respondent reimbursed Petitioner $100 for the cost of a portable heater. Respondent testified at the hearing that they provided Petitioner with a $100 rent credit in March 2023 to accommodate Petitioner for three to four months of cold weather and Petitioner having to bring a portable heater into the bathroom to warm up the temperature in the bathroom. (Hearing Recording, 00:11:00-00:11:40.) Later in the hearing, Respondent again clarified that the $100 rent credit in March 2023 was not for the water temperature issues, but rather because Petitioner had to bring in a portable heater to warm up the bathroom during the winter months. (Hearing Recording, 00:15:22-00:16:52.) Based on this testimony, it was reasonable for the Hearing Officer to conclude that Respondent was being reimbursed for having to use a portable heater. More importantly, Respondent does not allege that the Hearing Officer’s finding regarding the March 2023 rent credit affected the Hearing Officer’s ultimate decision on the petition.

# E. Hearing Officer’s Decision Does Not Contradict Respondent’s Argument Regarding Bacteria and Pathogens.

Finally, Respondent argues that the temperature for the water heater that serves the Property is always set between 120- and 140-degrees Fahrenheit, which means that the water is free from bacteria and other pathogens and safe for use by the tenants. The HO Decision reaches the same conclusion, stating that “[t]here was no evidence of any bacteria in the water or related health issues.” (HO Decision at pg. 4.)

# V. Conclusion

As detailed above, the RHC denies issues A, C, D and E of the Appeal. As to issue B, the Rental Housing Committee remands the decision to the Hearing Officer with instruction to gather further evidence and testimony regarding the standard applicable to residential dwelling units with regard to the provision of hot water.
