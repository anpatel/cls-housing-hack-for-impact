Rent includes housing services and, as stated above, housing services are broadly defined and include repairs, maintenance, and any other benefit connected with the use or occupancy of a rental unit. Petitioners have identified several housing services that have not been adequately maintained or repaired timely; such as the use of the elevator and the replacement of the lights in the common area. Although Petitioners believe that the property is not well maintained, it does appear that Woodland Park provides maintenance personnel. Moreover, during the inspection visit on May 17, the Hearing Officer did not observe any particular issues with how the property is maintained. Woodland Park acknowledges the elevator was out of service for some period of time and acknowledges that it has been tardy in replacing the lights in the common area. On the other hand, Woodland Park did respond timely to the water overflow in Petitioners' kitchen and apparently took steps to eradicate the roaches and mold.

Accordingly, Petitioners have carried their burden of proof that they are entitled to a rent reduction/rebate based on the loss of elevator service and the failure to replace the common area lights timely: A 7.5% reduction/rebate will be applied for a four month period from October 2023 through January 2024.

# DECISION

1. The petition for a rent reduction/rebate based on a reduction in housing services and/or failure to maintain or repair is granted; the rent is reduced by 7.5% from October 2023 through January 2024.
2. Petitioners are entitled to a reimbursement of rent in the amount of $268.56 [8895.22 X .075 = $67.14 X 4 months = $268.56]. Woodland Park may reimburse Petitioners that amount or apply it as a credit against future rent.
3. In all other respects, the petition is denied.
