Payments until such time as she has withheld a total of $34,931.23 plus any additional sums exceeding the current lawful rent of $1,530.00 for the Property that have been paid by Petitioner after January 31, 2024.

8. In the event that either Petitioner or Respondent terminates Petitionerâ€™s tenancy for any reason prior to delivery of the payments ordered by this Decision, the total amount then owed shall become due and payable to Petitioner immediately and if said amount is not paid, Petitioner shall be entitled to a money judgment in the amount of the unpaid payments in an action in court or any other administrative or judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding.

9. Respondent may not issue a Rent increase for the Property until (1) all refunds due to Petitioner are fully paid, and (2) Respondent has provided written notice to Petitioner of the rent increase at least 30 days in advance of such increase in the manner prescribed by the CSFRA and California law. CSFRA Regulations Ch. 7, Section (B)(1) requires that a notice in substantially the same form as that promulgated by the Rental Housing Committee must be served on Tenants for all rent increases.

10. In addition to complying with the requirements of Paragraph 9 above, Respondent may not issue a rent increase for the Property if Respondent is in violation of any of the provisions set forth in CSFRA Section 1707(f)(1)-(3) and CSFRA Regs. Ch. 12, Section (B), which require substantial compliance with the CSFRA and include, among other things, charging only lawful amounts of rent, registering the Property annually with the Rent Stabilization Division (see CSFRA Regs. Ch. 11), refunding all unlawfully charged rents for all Tenants, and maintaining the Property in habitable condition according to state law and the CSFRA, including making all repairs ordered hereunder or required by the City Building Department or other department of the City of Mountain View as a result of Multi-Family Housing Program Inspections. Only when Respondent has complied with all of the provisions of this paragraph and paragraph 9, above, may Respondent issue a rent increase, provided that it does so in a manner consistent with the CSFRA and California law.

11. If a dispute arises as to whether any party to this Appeal has failed to comply with this Appeal Decision, any party may request a Compliance Hearing pursuant to CSFRA Regulations, Ch. 5, Section J.1.
