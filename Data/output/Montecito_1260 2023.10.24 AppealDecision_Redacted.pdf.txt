# V. Conclusion

As detailed above, the RHC denies the appeal in its entirety and affirms the Decision in its entirety:

1. The Petitioner satisfied his burden of proof to demonstrate failure to provide a habitable premises for the period from December 12, 2022 to February 28, 2023, and is entitled to a twenty-five percent (25%) total reduction of the monthly maximum lawful rent for the Property for that period. The reduction reflects an awarded reduction of twenty percent (20%) for the presence of mold in the garage and the likely presence in the living room and a five percent (5%) reduction for the intrusion of water into the living room.
2. The Petitioner is entitled to a rent refund of $1,293.00 for the excess Rent he paid to Respondent between December 12, 2022, through January 31, 2023. Petitioner is not entitled to a rent refund for the period from February 1, 2023 through February 28, 2023 because he did not pay rent for that month.
3. To the extent that any future court or administrative proceedings between the parties adjudicate the question of what, if any, rent was due and payable from Petitioner for the period from February 1, 2023 through February 28, 2023, that adjudication should reflect both the reduction of rent ordered in the HO Decision as well as grant Petitioner an offset of $1,000.00 against any past-due rent awarded in those proceedings for the period from February 1, 2023 through February 28, 2023.
