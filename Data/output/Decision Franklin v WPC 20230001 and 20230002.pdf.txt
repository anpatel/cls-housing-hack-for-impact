Observe any repairs to the patio. Accordingly, Franklin has carried his burden of proof that he is entitled to a rent reduction based on the condition of the backyard patio and a 5% reduction in rent is reasonable. The reduction will be applied to the rent paid from July 2023 to the present and will continue until the condition of the backyard patio is fixed. Woodland Park's proposed solution to the condition of the patio is to "shave" the concrete in order to make the patio level. It is uncertain that will adequately address the condition.

# DECISION

1. The petition for a rent reduction based on a reduction in housing services and/or failure to maintain the rental unit as reflected in the condition of the backyard patio is granted; the rent is reduced by 5% from July 2023 to the present and continuing until the backyard patio condition has been repaired or, if it cannot be adequately repaired, replaced.
2. Franklin is entitled to a reimbursement of rent in the amount of $396.76 [$689.25 X 5% + $834.46 x 5 months = $172.30] + [$748.36 X 5% = $37.41 X 6 months = $224.46]. Woodland Park may reimburse Franklin that amount or apply it as a credit against June 2024 rent.
3. Until the backyard patio has been adequately repaired, Franklin's rent is reduced to $710.95 monthly. When the backyard patio has been repaired, Woodland Park is to notify the Rent Program who will confirm with Franklin that the backyard patio has been adequately repaired. If Franklin concurs, the monthly rent may be restored to $748.36.
4. If there is a disagreement that the backyard patio has been adequately repaired, the matter will be returned to the Hearing Officer for further consideration.
5. In all other respects, the petition is denied. The Hearing Officer retains jurisdiction over this matter as provided herein.
