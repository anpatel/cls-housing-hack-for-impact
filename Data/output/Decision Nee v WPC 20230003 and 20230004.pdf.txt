Broadly defined, those services focus on the physical characteristics of the rental unit: It is a landlord's failure to repair and maintain those physical characteristics that the Rent Ordinance and Regulations provide relief to an affected tenant. Housing services do include other benefits connected to the use or benefit of the rental unit but the Hearing Office is not inclined to give "benefit" too broad a reading. On the other hand, Woodland Park appears to be somewhat remiss in not taking more affirmative steps to remedy the noise complaints that Nee had made for some time.

Accordingly, Nee has carried her burden of proof that she is entitled to a rent reduction/rebate. Woodland Park has been on notice of the periodic roach infestation since at least 2022 based on Woodland Park's past failure to provide a long-term maintenance solution to this particular problem. A rent reduction of 7.5% from May 2022 to June 2024 is reasonable and takes into account not only the periodic roach infestation but also the presence of rats in 2023 and that tenant's dog. In that there was no evidence that these particular conditions exist at this time, there is no reduction in rent prospectively.

# DECISION

1. The petition for a rent reduction/rebate based on a reduction in maintenance/failure to maintain is granted; the rent is reduced by 7.5% from May 2022 to June 2024.
2. Nee is entitled to a reimbursement of rent in the amount of $2004.79 [$1023.60 X 7.5% + $876.77 x 12 months = $921.24 + $1111.39 x 7.5% = $83.35/month x 13 months = $1083.55]. Woodland Park may reimburse Nee that amount or apply it as a credit against future rent.
3. In all other respects, the petition is denied.
