More recently, Franklin brought to the attention of Woodland Park that the bathtub was in need of repair as part of it was coming apart and clogging the drain.\n\nMr. Zumarraga testified that Woodland Park had been responsive to the cracks in the outdoor patio and that in August 2023 a contractor (Innovative General Engineering) had submitted an invoice to Woodland Park that it had installed new concrete on the cracked slab and brushed to make a clean repair. He also testified that the bathtub would be re-glazed to prevent the chipping.\n\nFranklin disputed that any work had been done on the patio at any time and it did not appear to the Hearing Officer during the inspection that any repairs had been done to the outdoor patio.\n\nFrom December 2022 to December 2023, Franklin's rent was $689.25 monthly.

Franklin's evidence concerned a reduction in maintenance and services and habitability problems.\n\nThe evidence was clear both from the Hearing Officer's personal examination of the outdoor patio area and from the pictures Franklin submitted at the hearing that the outdoor patio area is cracked and uneven and that it has been that way for some time, possibly from the roots of trees that are on the other side of the patio fence. As stated above, contrary to the invoice submitted to Woodland Park that the patio area had been repaired in August 2023, there was no visual evidence of any work having been done in that location.\n\nIt does not appear that the condition of the patio area constitutes a failure of the landlord to comply with the \"warranty of habitability\" set forth in California Civil Code, section 1941.1. Nor does the condition of the patio constitute a failure to comply with building and housing codes or other legal requirements for the maintenance and operation of rental housing that affects the habitability and/or rental value of the rental unit.\n\nRent, however, includes housing services and, as stated above, housing services are broadly defined and include repairs, maintenance, and any other benefit connected with the use or occupancy of a rental unit. Certainly the use of backyard patio is a benefit connected with the use or occupancy of the rental unit and Franklin testified that the condition of the backyard patio has prevented him from using it. Moreover, the backyard patio has cracks and is uneven and it is evident that these conditions have existed for some time\u2014perhaps years\u2014indicating that the conditions are more than minor maintenance deficiencies or deterioration that have no or an insignificant impact on the livability or rental value of the rental unit.

Until the backyard patio has been adequately repaired, Franklin's rent is reduced to $710.95 monthly.\n\n4. When the backyard patio has been repaired, Woodland Park is to notify the Rent Program who will confirm with Franklin that the backyard patio has been adequately repaired. If Franklin concurs, the monthly rent may be restored to $748.36.\n\n5.
